#AVR assembly
This part is for the ATmega328P. I use all pins on PORTB, if you have an Arduino, it are pins 8-13 and the oscillator pins which aren't on the arduino board. So this means, that you need to have your ATmega programmed to use the internal oscillator. You can see how to do it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard).
